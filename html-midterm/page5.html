    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing I needed to change was the navbar on all pages. I included page 5 buy placing a link to it. </li>
        <li>I quickly noticed pages 1 and 4 were missing basic start lines !DOCTYPE html and html lang="en". I then added the neccesary lines.  </li>
        <li>On page 1, there was a element em that was misspelled and missing a dash</li>
        <li>A p element was missing a / in line 74 on page1 </li>
        <li>I recived a error on vscode that highlighted the apostraphe in yellow. I fixed this by replacing them by retyping them. </li>
    </ul>
