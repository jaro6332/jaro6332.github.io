    <h1>Changelog</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing I needed to change was the navbar on all pages. I included page 5 buy placing a link to it. </li>
        <li>I quickly noticed pages 1 and 4 were missing basic start lines !DOCTYPE html and html lang="en". I then added the neccesary lines.  </li>
        <li>On page 1, there was a element em that was misspelled and missing a dash.</li>
        <li>A p element was missing a / in line 74 on page1. </li>
        <li>I recived a error on vscode that highlighted the apostraphe in yellow. I fixed this by replacing them by retyping them. </li>
        <li>On page 1 I noticed thaat the h tags were out of order. on the live view, I saw the title was not where it was supposed to be so I fixed this by reorganizing the h1, h2, h3 tags by importance.</li>
        <li>The h tags were all wrong on page 2 so I fixed them by putting them in the correct order by determining heirarchy by looking at the source page. The highest it should have gone was for the word interior as h3. </li>
        <li>There was a missing hr element after the closure section.</li>
        <li>On page 2 there was an empty hyperlink which i fixed by placing the proper link in the correct place to take the user to the neccesary page.</li>
        <li>On page 3, I noticed in the table that the name Zapata was bolded so I fixed it by changing its th tag to td.</li>
        <li>Another element in the table that I fixed was the names of Lily, Axelia, and the age of Olatunkbo.</li>
        <li>In line 51 on page 3, the element li was unfinished so I completed the list.</li>
        <li>The first thing I noticed on page 4 was how the pictureof the orange cat and fishy thing were out of place, I fixed this by adding the neccesary td tags around the 2 picture links</li>
        <li>I saw that the pictures were not sorted properly for the designated headings. To fix this I rearraged the links so that in every tr tag there was first a dog picture, then a cat, then an other picture. </li>
    </ul>
