        <p><strong>Horror</strong> is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment
        purposes. Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad
        elements include monsters,<a href="https://maes4595.github.io/wa/wa3.html"> apocalyptic events,</a> and
        religious or folk beliefs. Cinematic techniques used in horror films have been shown to provoke psychological
        reactions in an audience.</p>
    <h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
    <p>The horror film is defined by The Dictionary of Film Studies as representing "disturbing and dark subject matter,
        seeking to elicit responses of fear, terror, disgust, shock, suspense, and, of course, horror from their
        viewers."[2] In the chapter "The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s" from Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan
        (2002), film critic Robin Wood declared that commonality between horror films are that "normality is threatened
        by the monster."[3] This was further expanded upon by The Philosophy of Horror, or Parodoxes of the Heart by
        Noël Carroll who added that "repulsion must be pleasurable, as evidenced by the genre's popularity."</p>
    <h3>Cinemetic techniques</h3>
    <p>The jump scare is a horror film trope, where an abrupt change in image accompanied with a loud sound intends to
        surprise the viewer.[15] This can also be subverted to create tension, where an audience may feel more unease
        and discomfort by anticipating a jump scare.[15] Mirrors are often used in horror films is to create visual
        depth and build tension. Shelton argues mirrors have been used so frequently in horror films that audiences have
        been conditioned to fear them, and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further
        build tension.[15] Tight framing and close-ups are also commonly used; these can build tension and induce
        anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is around the protagonist.[15]</p>

    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Music is considered a key component of horror films. In Music in the Horror Film (2010), Lerner writes "music in
        horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable" and intends to intensify the atmosphere
        created in imagery and themes. Dissonance, atonality and experiments with timbre are typical characteristics
        used by composers in horror film music.[16]</p>
    <h3>Themes</h3>
    <p>In the book Dark Dreams, author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes: the
        horror of personality, horror of Armageddon and the horror of the demonic.[17] The horror of personality derives
        from monsters being at the centre of the plot, such Frankenstein's monster whose psychology makes them perform
        unspeakable horrific acts ranging from rapes, mutilations and sadistic killings.[17] Other key works of this
        form are Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which feature psychotic murderers without the make-up of a monster.[17] The
        second 'Armageddon' group delves on the fear of large-scale destruction, which ranges from science fiction works
        but also of natural events, such as Hitchcock's The Birds (1963).[17] The last group of the "Fear of the
        Demonic" features graphic accounts of satanic rites, witchcraft, exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship,
        as seen in films like The Exorcist (1973) or The Omen (1976).[18]</p>
    <h2 id="History">History</h2>
    <h3>Early influences and films</h3>
    <p>Beliefs in the supernatural, devils and ghosts have existed in folklore and religions of many cultures for
        centuries; these would go on to become integral parts of the horror genre.[24] Zombies, for example, originated
        from Haitian folklore.[25] Prior to the development of film in the late 1890s, Gothic fiction was developed.[26]
        These included Frankenstein (1818) and short stories by Edgar Allan Poe, which would later have several film
        adaptations.[27] By the late 1800s and early 1900s, more key horror texts would be developed than any other
        period preceding it.[28] While they were not all straight horror stories, the horrific elements of them lingered
        in popular culture, with their set pieces becoming staples in horror cinema.[29]</p>
    <h3>1930s</h3>
    <p>Following the 1927 success of Broadway play of Dracula, Universal Studios officially purchased the rights to both
        the play and the novel.[33][34][35] After the Dracula's premiere on February 12, 1931, the film received what
        authors of the book Universal Horrors proclaimed as "uniformly positive, some even laudatory" reviews.[36] The
        commercial reception surprised Universal who forged ahead to make similar production of Frankenstein
        (1931).[37][38] Frankenstein also proved to be a hit for Universal which led to both Dracula and Frankenstein
        making film stars of their leads: Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff respectively.[39] Karloff starred in Universal's
        follow-up The Mummy (1932), which Newman described as the studio knowing "what they were getting" patterning the
        film close to the plot of Dracula.[39] Lugosi and Karloff would star together in several Poe-adaptations in the
        1930s.[40]</p>

    <h3>1940s</h3>
    <p>After the success of Son of Frankenstein (1939), Universal's horror films received what author Rick Worland of
        The Horror Film called "a second wind" and horror films continued to be produced at a feverish pace into the
        mid-1940s.[45] Universal looked into their 1930s horror properties to develop new follow-ups such in their The
        Invisible Man and The Mummy series.[46] Universal saw potential in making actor Lon Chaney, Jr. a new star to
        replace Karloff as Chaney had not distinguished himself in either A or B pictures.[47] </p>

    <h3>1980s</h3>
    <p>With the appearance of home video in the 1980s, horror films were subject to censorship in the United Kingdom in
        a phenomenon popularly known as "video nasties", leading to video collections being seized by police and some
        people being jailed for selling or owning some horror films.[78] Newman described the response to the video
        nasty issue led to horror films becoming "dumber than the previous decade" and although films were not less
        gory, they were "more lightweight [...] becoming more disposable, less personal works."[79][78] Newman noted
        that these directors who created original material in the 1970s such as Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Tobe
        Hooper would all at least briefly "play it safe" with Stephen King adaptations or remakes of the 1950s horror
        material.[80]</p>
    <h3>2010s to present</h3>
    <p>After the film studio Blumhouse had success with Paranormal Activity (2007), the studio continued to produce
        films became hits in the 2010s with film series Insidious.[104] This led to what Newman described as the
        companies policy on "commercial savvy with thematic risk that has often paid off", such as Get Out (2017) and
        series like The Purge.[104][105] Laura Bradley in her article for Vanity Fair noted that both large and small
        film studios began noticing Blumhouse's success, including A24, which became popular with films like The Witch
        (2015) and Midsommar (2019).[104] Bradley commented how some of these films had been classified as "elevated
        horror", a term used for works that were 'elevated' beyond traditional or pure genre films, but declared "horror
        aficionados and some critics pushed back against the notion that these films are doing something entirely new"
        noting their roots in films like Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Rosemary's Baby (1968).[104] The increase
        in use of streaming services in the 2010s has also been suggested as boosting the popularity of horror; as well
        as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video producing and distributing numerous works in the genre, Shudder launched in
        2015 as a horror-specific service.[106] In the early 2010s, a wave of horror films began exhibiting what
        Virginie Sélavy described as psychedelic tendency. This was inspired by experimentation and subgenres of the
        1970s, specifically folk horror.[107] The trend began with Enter the Void (2009) and Beyond the Black Rainbow
        (2010) and continued throughout the decade with films like Climax (2018).[107]</p>

    <h2 id="Sub-genresofhorrorfilms">Sub-genres of horror films</h2>
    <h3>Body Horror</h3>
    <p>A genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation. In these
        films, the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and
        collapse.[113][114] In these films, the focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being
        overtaken, but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching
        their own body change.[113] The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg,
        specifically with early films like Shivers (1975).[113][114] Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester
        declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also pleasure and
        excitement such as in The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986).[115]</p>
    <h3>Comedy horror</h3>
    <p>Comedy horror combines elements of comedy and horror film. The comedy horror genre often crosses over with the
        black comedy genre. It occasionally includes horror films with lower ratings that are aimed at a family
        audience. The short story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving is cited as "the first great
        comedy-horror story".[116]</p>
    <h3>Folk horror</h3>
    <p>Folk horror uses elements of folklore or other religious and cultural beliefs to instil fear in audiences. Folk
        horror films have featured rural settings and themes of isolation, religion and nature.[117][118] Frequently
        cited examples are Witchfinder General (1968), The Blood on Satan's Claw (1971), The Wicker Man (1973) and
        Midsommar (2019).[117][118] Local folklore and beliefs have been noted as being prevalent in horror films from
        the Southeast Asia region, including Thailand and Indonesia.[119][120]</p>
    <h3>Found footage horror</h3>
    <p>The found footage horror film "technique" gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen, and
        presents the footage as being discovered after. Horror films which are framed as being made up of
        "found-footage" merge the experiences of the audience and characters, which may induce suspense, shock, and
        bafflement.[121] Alexandra Heller-Nicholas noted that the popularity of sites like YouTube in 2006 sparked a
        taste for amateur media, leading to the production of further films in the found footage horror genre later in
        the 2000s including the particularly financially successful Paranormal Activity (2007).[122]</p>
    <h3>Gothic horror</h3>
    <p>In their book Gothic film, Richard J. McRoy and Richard J. Hand stated that "Gothic" can be argued as a very
        loose subgenre of horror, but argued that "Gothic" as a whole was a style like film noir and not bound to
        certain cinematic elements like the Western or science fiction film.[123] The term "gothic" is frequently used
        to describe a stylized approach to showcasing location, desire, and action in film. Contemporary views of the
        genre associate it with imagery of castles at hilltops and labyrinth like ancestral mansions that are in various
        states of disrepair.[124] Narratives in these films often focus on an audiences fear and attraction to social
        change and rebellion.[125] The genre can be applied to films as early as The Haunted Castle (1896), Frankenstein
        (1910) as well as to more complex iterations such as Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013) and Jordan Peele's Get Out
        (2017).[123]</p>
    <h3>Natural horror</h3>
    <p>Also described as "eco-horror", the natural horror film is a subgenre "featuring nature running amok in the form
        of mutated beasts, carnivorous insects, and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold-blooded
        killers."[131][132] In 1963, Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with The Birds
        (1963) that was expanded into a trend into the 1970s. Following the success of Willard (1971), a film about
        killer rats, 1972 had similar films with Stanley (1972) and an official sequel Ben (1972).[133] Other films
        followed in suit such as Night of the Lepus (1972), Frogs (1972), Bug (1975), Squirm (1976) and what Muir
        described as the "turning point" in the genre with Jaws (1975), which became the highest-grossing film at that
        point and moved the animal attacks genres "towards a less-fantastic route" with less giant animals and more
        real-life creatures such as Grizzly (1976) and Night Creature (1977), Orca (1977), and Jaws 2
        (1978).[133][134][135] The film is linked with the environmental movements that became more mainstream in the
        1970s and early 1980s such vegetarianism, animal rights movements, and organizations such as Greenpeace.[136]
        Following Jaws, sharks became the most popular animal of the genre, ranging from similar such as Mako: The Jaws
        of Death (1976) and Great White (1981) to the Sharknado film series.[136] James Marriott found that the genre
        had "lost momentum" since the 1970s while the films would still be made towards the turn of the millennium.[137]
    </p>
    <h3>Slasher film</h3>
    <p>The slasher film is a horror subgenre, which involving a killer murdering a group of people (usually teenagers),
        usually by use of bladed tools.[138] In his book on the genre, author Adam Rockoff that these villains
        represented a "rogue genre" of films with "tough, problematic, and fiercely individualistic."[139] Following the
        financial success of Friday the 13th (1980), at least 20 other slasher films appeared in 1980 alone.[78] These
        films usually revolved around five properties: unique social settings (campgrounds, schools, holidays) and a
        crime from the past committed (an accidental drowning, infidelity, a scorned lover) and a ready made group of
        victims (camp counselors, students, wedding parties).[140] The genre was derided by several contemporary film
        critics of the era such as Ebert, and often were highly profitable in the box office.[82] The release of Scream
        (1996), led to a brief revival of the slasher films for the 1990s.[141] Other countries imitated the American
        slasher film revival, such as South Korea's early 2000s cycle with Bloody Beach (2000), Nightmare (2000) and The
        Record (2000).[142]</p>
    <h3>Supernatural horror</h3>
    <p>Supernatural horror films integrate supernatural elements, such as the afterlife, spirit possession and religion
        into the horror genre.[143]</p>
    <h3>Teen horror</h3>
    <p>Teen horror is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while usually promoting strong, anti-conformity
        teenage leads, appealing to young generations. This subgenre often depicts themes of sex, under-aged drinking,
        and gore.[144] Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in the 1950s with
        several productions from American International Pictures (AIP) and productions of Herman Cohen with I Was a
        Teenage Werewolf (1957) and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957).[59] This led to later productions like Daughter
        of Dr. Jekyll (1957) and Frankenstein's Daughter (1958).[59] Teen horror cycle in the 1980s often showcased
        explicit gore and nudity, with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary conservative tales where most of the
        films stated if you partook in such vices such as drugs or sex, your punishment of death would be handed
        out.[145] Prior to Scream, there were no popular teen horror films in the early 1990s.[146] After the financial
        success of Scream, teen horror films became increasingly reflexive and self-aware until the end of the 1990s
        with films like I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and non-slasher The Faculty (1998).[147][146] The genre
        lost prominence as teen films dealt with threats with more realism in films like Donnie Darko (2001) and
        Crazy/Beautiful (2001).[148] In her book on the 1990s teen horror cycle, Alexandra West described the general
        trend of these films is often looked down upon by critics, journals, and fans as being too glossy, trendy, and
        sleek to be considered worthwhile horror films.[149]</p>
    <h3>Psychological horror</h3>
    <p>Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror and psychological fiction with a particular focus on mental,
        emotional, and psychological states to frighten, disturb, or unsettle its audience. The subgenre frequently
        overlaps with the related subgenre of psychological thriller, and often uses mystery elements and characters
        with unstable, unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the suspense, drama, action, and
        paranoia of the setting and plot and to provide an overall unpleasant, unsettling, or distressing
        atmosphere.[150]</p>

    <h2 id="Regionalhorrorfilms">Regional horror films</h2>
    <h3>Asian Horror films</h3>
    <p>Horror films in Asia have been noted as being inspired by national, cultural or religious folklore, particularly
        beliefs in ghosts or spirits.[119][24] In Asian Horror, Andy Richards writes that there is a "widespread and
        engrained acceptance of supernatural forces" in many Asian cultures, and suggests this is related to animist,
        pantheist and karmic religious traditions, as in Buddhism and Shintoism.[24] Although Chinese, Japanese, Thai
        and Korean horror has arguably received the most international attention,[24] horror also makes up a
        considerable proportion of Cambodian[151] and Malaysian cinema.[152]</p>
    <h4>India</h4>
    <p>The Cinema of India produces the largest amount of films in the world, ranging from Bollywood (Hindi cinema based
        in Mumbai) to other regions such as West Bengal and Tamil Nadu. Unlike Hollywood and most Western cinematic
        traditions, horror films produced in India incorporate romance, song-and-dance, and other elements in the
        "masala" format,[153] where as many genres as possible are bundled into a single film.[154] Odell and Le Blanc
        described the Indian horror film as "a popular, but minor part of the country's film output" and that "has not
        found a true niche in mainstream Indian cinema."[154][155] These films are made outside of Mumbai, and are
        generally seen as disreputable to their more respectable popular cinema.[154] As of 2007, the Central Board of
        Film Certification, India's censorship board has stated films "pointless or unavoidable scenes of violence,
        cruelty and horror, scenes of violence intended to provide entertainment and such scene that may have the effect
        of desensitising or dehumanizing people are not shown."[156]</p>

        <h4>Indonesia</h4>
        <p>Indonesian horror refers to horror films produced in the Indonesian film industry. Often inspired by local folklore,[166][167] Indonesian horror films have been produced in the country since the 1960s. After a hiatus during the Suharto era in the 1990s when censorship affected production, Indonesian horror films continued being produced following Reformasi in 1998.[168][169]
        </p>
        <h3>European horror films</h3>
        <p>Ian Olney described the horror films of Europe were often more erotic and "just plain stranger" than their British and American counter-parts.[198] European horror films (generally referred to as Euro Horror)[199] draw from distinctly European cultural sources, including surrealism, romanticism, decadent tradition, early 20th century pulp-literature, film serials, and erotic comics.[200] In comparison to the narrative logic in American genre films, these films focused on imagery, excessiveness, and the irrational.[201] Between the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s, European horror films emerged from counties like Italy, Spain and France and were shown in the United States predominantly at drive-in theatre and grindhouse theatres.[198] As producers and distributors all over the world were interested in horror films, regardless of their origin changes started occurring in European low-budget filmmaking that allowed for productions in the 1960s and 1970s for horror films from Italy, France, Germany, United Kingdom and Spain, as well as co-productions between these countries.[202] Several productions, such as those in Italy were co-productions due to the lack of international stars within the country.[203] European horror films began developing strong cult following since the late 1990s.[198]</p>
        <h4>France</h4>
        <p>France never truly developed a horror film movement to the volume that the United Kingdom or Italy had produced.[204] In their book European Nightmares, editors Patricia Allmer, Emily Brick, and David Huxley noted that French cinema was generally perceived as having a tradition of the fantastic, rather than horror films. The editors noted that French cinema had produced a series of outstanding individual horror films, from directors who did not specialize in the field.[205] In their book Horror Films, Colin Odell & Michelle Le Blanc referred to director Jean Rollin as one of the countries most consistent horror auteurs with 40 years of productions described as "highly divisive" low budget horror films often featuring erotic elements, vampires, low budgets, pulp stories and references to both high and low European art.[206] Another of the few French directors who specialized in horror is Alexandre Aja, who stated that "the problem with the French is that they don't trust their own language [when it comes to horror]. American horror movies do well, but in their own language, the French just aren't interested."[205]</p>
        <h4>Italy</h4>
        <p>Early silent Italian fantastique films focused more on adventure and farce opposed to Germany's expressionism.[221] The National Fascist Party in Italy had forced film in the early sound era to "spread the civilization of Rome throughout the world as quickly as possible."[222] Another influence was the Centro Cattolico Cinematografico (Catholic Cinematic Centre) that was described by Curti as "permissive towards propaganda and repressive against anything related to sexuality or morality."[222] The Vatican City's newspaper L'Osservatore Romano for example, critiqued the circulation of films like Bride of Frankenstein (1935) in 1940.[222]</p>

    <h3>Psychological effects</h3>
    <p>In a study done by Uri Hasson et al., brain waves were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
        This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that
        audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still
        as possible while watching horror films.[263]</p>
    <h3>Physical effects</h3>
    <p>In a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noise (500 Hz) in long durations
            has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range).[265]
            Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and
            low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems.[266] Though most horror films keep the audio around 20–30
            Hz, the noise can still be unsettling in long durations.[15]</p>

            <h2 id="Reception">Reception</h2>
            <h3>In film criticism</h3>
            <p>Critic Robin Wood was not the first film critic to take the horror film seriously, but his article Return
                of the Repressed in 1978 helped inaugurate the horror film into academic study as a genre.[271] Wood
                later stated that he was surprised that his work, as well as the writing of Richard Lippe and Andrew
                Britton would receive "historic importance" intellectual views of the film genre.[271] William Paul in
                his book Laughing Screaming comments that "the negative definition of the lower works would have it that
                they are less subtle than higher genres. More positively, it could be said that they are more direct.
                Where lower forms are explicit, higher forms tend to operate more by indirection. Because of this
                indirection the higher forms are often regarded as being more metaphorical, and consequently more
                resonant, more open to the exegetical analyses of the academic industry."[272]</p>
            <h3>Censorship</h3>
            <p>Many horror films have been the subject of moral panic, censorship and legal controversy.

                In the United Kingdom, film censorship has frequently been applied to horror films.[286] A moral panic
                over several slasher films in the 1980s led to many of them being banned but released on videotape; the
                phenomenon became popularly termed "video nasties".[287][288] Constraints on permitted subject matter in
                Indonesian films has also influenced Indonesian horror films.[289] In March 2008, China banned all
                horror films from its market.[290]</p>
